title: Lisp Macro Programming

### Macros
Macros are the heart and soul of [meta-programming](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-metaprog1/index.html) in Lisp. They are snippets of code that write or modify either themselves or other parts of the source code, allowing you to create *DSL*s or *domain specific languages*, your own special programming dialect. They work by receiving source code itself as their arguments and then transforming that source code accordingly, a process known as [macro expansion](http://www.bookshelf.jp/texi/onlisp/onlisp_8.html#How Macros Work).

Macros exist in other programming languages such as **Dylan**, **Scala**, and **Nemerle** but are most commonly used in the Lisp family (Common Lisp, Racket, Scheme, etc). This is due to the [homoiconic](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/03/23/five-dollar-words-for-programmers-part-three-homoiconic.aspx) nature of Lisp, which enable the existence of a simple yet comprehensive Macro system.

### Samples please...
This is a short example of the potential use of Macros. In Lisp we use the the [Polish or prefix notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation) for code evaluation, this includes mathematical operations.

<section class="shell">
    CL-USER> (+ 3 2)
    5
    CL-USER> (+ 4 9)
    13
</section>

But what if we wanted to use *infix notation* (infix notation is the standard way we write equations; "1 + 2", "8 * 7", and so forth)? How would we go about making Lisp do that?

Enter the Macro:

<section class="code">
{% highlight cl %}
    (defmacro infix-math (x op y)
      (if (member op '(+ * - /))
          `(,op ,x ,y)))
{% endhighlight %}
</section>

This snippet is telling the Lisp interpreter that whenever it sees the symbol `infix-math` where the first and last variables are numbers, and the middle variable is a valid mathematical operator, to put the operator at the beginning and evaluate the expression.

Let's see this in action.

<section class="shell">
    CL-USER> (INFIX-MATH 1 + 2)
    3
    CL-USER> (INFIX-MATH 1 * 2)
    2
    CL-USER> (INFIX-MATH 1 s 3)
    NIL
</section>

As you can see the expressions were entered using infix notation, and Lisp evaluated them correctly. The last example showed what would happen if the operator was not valid.

Now let's take a look at how our macro is being transformed once it is evaluated. We can use the built-in function `macroexpand` for this purpose.

<section class="shell">
    CL-USER> (macroexpand `(INFIX-MATH 1 * 2))
    (* 1 2)
    T
</section>

Take a look at the return value, what did the interpreter do? It basically took the arguments and rearranged them into prefix notation before evaluating them. This is what we told it to do every time it encountered `infix-math`.

<section class="code">
    (defmacro infix-math (x op y)
      (if (member op '(+ * - /))
<section class="highlight">      
      `(,op ,x ,y)))
</section>
</section>

The arguments are entered in the order of *x* *operator* *y*, and reorders them into *operator* *x* *y*.

`\(\ast\)` *Macros are expanded during compile-time and not run-time (that is, before the sourced code is evaluated)*

### Variable Capture
As you can see, defining a macro is almost exactly the same as defining a function. There is something to watch out for however, something called **variable capture**. This happens when the definition of a macro uses a certain variable, say `\(x\)`, and the function that calls that specific macro also uses the variable `\(x\)`.

<section class="code">
{% highlight cl %}
(defmacro split (lst yes no)
  `(let ((x ,lst))
     (if x
         (let ((head (car x))
               (tail (cdr x)))
           ,yes)
       ,no)))
{% endhighlight %}
</section>

This is  a very simple and immature macro that takes a list and assigns the variables `head` and `tail` to the first and rest of the elements if the list exists. There are also expressions to be evaluated in the case the list is valid or not.

Sample Usage:

<section class="shell">
    CL-USER> (split '(2 3) 
                    (format t "the list is splittable, the first element is ~a, and the rest are ~a" head tail)
                    (format t "the list is not splittable"))
    the list is splittable, the first element is 2, and the rest are (3)

    CL-USER> (split '()
                    (format t "the list is splittable, the first element is ~a, and the rest are ~a" head tail)
                    (format t "the list is not splittable"))
    the list is not splittable
</section>

As you can see, when passed a valid list, our `split` macro evaluates the first expression and variables `head` and `tail` are tied to the `car` and `cdr` of the list. When it is passed an empty list, the macro evaluates the second expression.

So what's the problem with this definition? Well, what about if you call `split` inside a lambda function (like `let`) and have a local variable `\(x\)` defined?

<section class="shell">
    (let ((x 100))
               (split '(2 3)
                      (print x)
                      nil))
    (2 3)
</section>

Uh Oh! We defined a local variable `\(x\)` and assigned it the value of 100, so why is our function printing `(2 3)` when we tell it to print `\(x\)`?

Let's try a macroexpansion to see what the problem is.

<section class="shell">
    CL-USER> (let ((x 100))
               (macroexpand `(split '(2 3)
                      (print x)
                      nil)))

    (LET ((X '(2 3)))
      (IF X
          (LET ((HEAD (CAR X)) (TAIL (CDR X)))
            (PRINT X))
          NIL))
    T
</section>

If you remember our definition of `split`, we assigned the value of `lst` the variable `\(x\)` , overwriting the `\(x\)` variable of the outer `let` function. This is known as **variable capture**.

A simple solution would be to use a really long and hopefully unique name in our macro definition to avoid this problem like `thisisauniquevariablename`.

This leads us to...

### `(gensym)`
[`(gensym)`](http://www.bookshelf.jp/texi/onlisp/onlisp_10.html#SEC73) returns a unique symbol everytime it's called. Let's see it in action.

<section class="shell">
    CL-USER> (gensym)
    #:G897
</section>

We can use this to avoid the variable capture that happened in our previous example.

<section class="code">
{% highlight cl %}
    (defmacro split (lst yes no)
      (let ((x (gensym)))
        `(let ((,x ,lst))
           (if ,x
               (let ((head (car ,x))
                     (tail (cdr ,x)))
                 ,yes)
             ,no))))
{% endhighlight %}
</section>

We bind the variable `\(x\)` to a symbol generated by `(gensym)`. This is done outside the backtick which means it will be run during compile time. Then we use the ***value*** of `\(x\)` (the `gensym` symbol) as a variable name and assign the value of the `lst` argument to it. This part is run during run-time, as evidenced by the backtick. 

Now everytime we want to reference the value of `lst`, we can use `,x` which will call the gensym-generated symbol. 

If expanded, this would be equivalent to:

<section class="code">
{% highlight cl %}
    (let ((x '#g134))
      `(let (( '#g134 '(2 3)))
         (if '(2 3)
             (let ((head (car '#g134))
                   (tail (car '#g134)))
               ....
               ....
{% endhighlight %}
</section>

Now to see if we have resolved the variable capture issue.

<section class="shell">
    CL-USER> (let ((x 100))
               (split '(2 3)
                      (print x)
                      nil))

    100 
</section>

`\(x\)` is now free to be used in the outer functions. 

`\(\ast\)` *`split` macro and variable capture example are taken from Barski's Land of Lisp.*

### Best Practices?
One common mistake with beginners writing macros is that they usually have the habit of using them where they shouldn't be used. We can write, for example, an `add-elements` function that adds all the elements in a list together like so, using our split function:

<section class="code">
{% highlight cl %}
    (defun add-elements (lst)
      (let ((x 0))
        (labels ((f (lst)
                    (split lst
                           (progn (setq x (+ x head))
                                  (f tail))
                           nil)))
          (f lst))
        x))
{% endhighlight %}
</section>

<section class="shell">
    CL-USER> (add-elements '(1 2 3 4))
    10
</section>

However we could also just do this:

<section class="code">
{% highlight cl %}
    (defun add-elements-functional (lst)
      (reduce #'+ lst))
{% endhighlight %}
</section>

<section class="shell">
    CL-USER> (add-elements-functional '(1 2 3 4))
    10
</section>

Besides being shorter and more concise, we didn't have to rely on any custom-defined macro. This makes it easier to maintain, especially if there are other members in the team or if the code will be passed on to another programmer in the future.

Another thing that may happen, this is on how to write macros themselves, is that sometimes within the macro source variables are evaluated more than once.

For example, let's write a macro called `if-var`. `if-var` returns the value of the argument passed to it or a `nil` if it is a nil (think empty list, kind of similar to `(nullp)`):

<section class="code">
{% highlight cl %}
    (defmacro if-var (var)
      `(if ,var
           ,var
         nil))
{% endhighlight %}
</section>

Now to see what the possible problem here is, we'll pass it a `progn` form:

<section class="shell">
    (if-var (progn (print "evaluated")
                            t))

    "evaluated" 
    "evaluated" 
    T
</section>

The argument was evaluated twice (we can see that because the string "evaluated", which is part of the argument, was printed twice)! Why did this happen?

If you look back on the macro that was just defined, you can see that `,var` appears twice in the code.

<section class="code">
    (defmacro if-var (var)
<section class="highlight">
      `(if ,var
           ,var 
</section>
         nil))
</section>

To avoid this, we have to write the code in a way that it only evaluates once.

<section class="code">
{% highlight cl %}
    (defmacro if-var (var)
      `(let ((x ,var))
         (if x
             x
           nil)))
{% endhighlight %}
</section>

Now let's rerun it with the same argument:

<section class="shell">
    (if-var (progn (print "evaluated")
                            t))

    "evaluated" 
    T
</section>

So here we can see that it only evaluated once! This is because `,var` only makes one appearance in the code, it's value is immediately stored in a local variable which is used the rest of the time.

### To sum it up
Macros are incredibly powerful and make possible what would otherwise not be possible, or extremely difficult. However there is a tendency to abuse them, to use them where there is no need. A nice rule of thumb is to use them not when it would be easier for the coder, but when the alternative would otherwise be incredibly complex or even outright impossible.
