A wannabe mathematician/computer scientist, my hacking skills are completely self-taught. My interests lie mainly in machine learning and AI (thanks to my exposure to Lisp), and in applied math.

Thanks to resources such as [Dive into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/), [Bash Guide for Beginners](http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/) (a lot of people don't like this book but it worked wonders on me), and [Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/) I managed to start learning some coding concepts and skills on my own.

Some of my previous work:

- <span class="emphasis1">[**Jekyll**]</span> [This site](/index.html)
- <span class="emphasis1">[**Django**]</span> [Yoga Momo](http://www.yoga-momo.com)

***formerly*** done by me (they must not have been very happy with my work):

- <span class="emphasis1">[**Django**]</span> [The Wheat Grass Specialists](http://thewheatgrassspecialists.com/)
- <span class="emphasis1">[**Django**]</span> [The Italian Food Specialists](http://italianfoodspecialists.com/)

Some of my projects can be found here:

- [Github](https://github.com/paradigmshift)
- [Gitorious](https://gitorious.org/~momo-reina)

This is my [Stack Overflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/355542/momo).

I am currently based in Osaka, Japan, and when I'm not getting up at 3 AM to do my [Ashtanga Yoga](http://kpjayi.org) practice I'm either teaching the Mysore program at [Spirit Yoga](http://www.spirityogastudio.com) or in some random cafe boning up on my math and hacking.
